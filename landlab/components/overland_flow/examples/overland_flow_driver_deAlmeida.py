Simple driver showing how to use the de Almeida's overland flow component in Landlab.
This driver sets up their test case from de Almeida et al., 2012, where output
from the Bates et al., 2010, de Almeida et al., 2012 and analytical solutions 
are compared. 

This is a componentized version of the driver example
